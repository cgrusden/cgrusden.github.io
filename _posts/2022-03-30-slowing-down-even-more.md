title: 'Slowing down even more'
---

After camping recently, it was a nice to look back and see what made it awesome. 

Each day I ate dinner “early” by today’s standards around 5PM EST. I was back at the campsite shortly after that and it was: get a fire started before the sun went down, sit there and chill for a couple hours while the fire burns, then goto sleep outside. 

I’m going to attempt to follow that same kinda lifestyle while in the city. Start to slow down around 6PM, no tv, nothing, just watch the world go by. Not even read. And then get in bed.
