title: 'The news and media suck these days'
---

I totally understand that people “want to stay current with world events”, but right now, with Ukraine, we just got done with Covid, inflation, etc… why bother? Just enjoy your day. 

Don’t look at the headlines or click on links that friends send inside of group text messages unless it’s something youre really into. 

I love that my friends send me stuff, but right now, we gotta put the oxygen mask on ourselves. The media’s entire job is to get eyeballs on articles. They are going to write the worst headlines that if you just see them, you’ll get anxiety. I promise. Just avoid it. Listen to NPR if you have to, even then, I wouldn’t.
