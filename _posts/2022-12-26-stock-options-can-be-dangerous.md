The title is being more dramatic than it needs to be. Options *can be* dangerous. In future posts, i'll write more in depth about them and my experience with them.

Options can be a great tool to learn. The hard part is not getting too caught up in the hoop-lah and thinking they'll make you rich over night.  I've seen them make more people broke over night than rich.

There are plenty option strategies to learn. The basics though, are writing a PUT and Covered Call. Those are the two _safest_ options to write as a normal retail investor. 

The best thing to know starting off in the stock market though is, steer clear of options for the time being, but don't be afraid of them.
