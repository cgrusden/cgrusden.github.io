title: 'Violence of mind'

Listened to a podcast on Art of Manliness with Varg Freeborn about violence and the mental capacity it takes to do so. [podcast](https://the-art-of-manliness.simplecast.com/episodes/beyond-ooda-developing-the-orientation-for-conflict-and-violence)

It made me think about a lot of self-defense things and also the extreme commitment to become a sheepdog, or not. Varg talked about how criminals that want to harm you and your family have gone through violence, sometimes deadly, experiences that you have not yet experienced. You may never experience them. 

The gist was, we prepare by learning jiu jit su, or karate,  learn how to fire a gun properly, do all the training for that etc… When it comes down to it though, are you emotionally prepared to do what you’ve been training for? The thought of taking someone else’s life is over-the-top. I can’t really even think about it and thats Varg’s point. You have to start thinking of that scenario if you think you’re going to defend your family. He brought up a good point: we all think we will rise to the occasion, but most of the time people that think they can defend their family will freeze up.

All too often I feel people throw around “Yea, I could do it when it came down to it”, myself included. I haven’t really trained to extremes in a pressure and stress induced theatre. This is why special forces (and most military combat groups) can go into a situation that we would say, “Hell no”, to.  

They’re just more familiar with the body’s responses and have gone through the training to experience that first hand when most of us haven’t. 

The gist is, you probably aren’t familiar with being shot at, much less shot and survived. People that intend to do harm *usually* have experienced this to some degree and have the upper hand on you. 

There’s no way to really train for that, but I’m going to give his book a go and see if there’s ways to “visualize” those scenarios and potentially gain somewhat of an understanding. 

Ps - I’ve boxed in the past, a lot, and the number rule of boxing is: try never to get into a fight in general, it’s not worth it. Walk away
