title: 'Wolves, Sheep, and Sheepdogs'
---

This topic has been beaten into our minds for awhile. You can learn more about the definitions in the following article I link to at Art of Manliness ([Are You a Sheep or Sheepdog? Part I | The Art of Manliness](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/are-you-a-sheep-or-sheepdog/))

This article made me realize a lot of people, myself included, that want to be a sheepdog really need to come to terms with the “Live by the sword, die by the sword”. Are you willing to die for what you are training for? Like, really, if you’re defending someone in public, are you ready to die over it? You may never come that close to death, but theres a chance. You have your bad days and good days, and that just may be the bad day to be a protector for you, but it is what it is.

Are you OK with not going home to see your mom, wife, or kids on a random Tuesday because you decided to attempt to defend a woman that is being harassed by someone? And that someone has a gun you don’t know about and they decide to pull it out and use it on you instead of her because you decided to get into a argument with them? 

It’s a tough question. And it’s a decision to become a Sheepdog that should take some long consideration for.
