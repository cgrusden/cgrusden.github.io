title: 'Be curious, not judgmental'
---

There’s a TV show that came out called “Ted Lasso” and its by Jason Sudekis, the comedian. Watching a few interviews of him about the show he said he wanted a nice, positive, feel good show with very little drama (that was the gist). 

There’s a scene where he’s throwing darts,  and he says something about seeing a sign somewhere by Walt Whitman, “Be curious, not judgemental”. 

Super profound. 

Most people default to giving unsolicited advice, the other thing we don’t do very is try to understand more about the people we’re interacting with. We’re too caught up in ourselves etc… If we just learned a little about who we talk to we’d not piss them off and we’d have a better conversation with them.

This is especially true for intimate relationships which are really no different than any other relationship we have, whether it be business, family, or just friends.
