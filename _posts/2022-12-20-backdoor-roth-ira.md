You’ll hear this term thrown around. All this means is, you have a regular retirement account of some sorta, like a Traditional 401K or IRA  that has a lot of money in it and you want to move some of that money into a ROTH IRA.

First, you’d need to have a traditional IRA or 401k account already that has a significant amount of money in it in my opinion. Hundreds of thousands of dollars would be a good start. Then you would have to open a ROTH IRA account. 

What you would do is, for a number of years, you would contribute to your traditional IRA/401k and when you build that account up to be pretty big, you can start looking at ways to convert chunks, or a big chunk, of that into your ROTH. 

Watch out though, any money you “convert “from your traditional account into your ROTH will be taxed like regular income. So if you don’t work and have $0 income for a particular year and you decided to backdoor-roth-convert $50,000 from your traditional retirement to your ROTH, the IRS is going to see that $50,000 as your income for the year and you’ll be in whatever tax bracket as if you made $50,000 for the year.
