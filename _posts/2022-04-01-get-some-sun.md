title: 'Get some sun'
---

Went glamping this weekend with my girlfriend and it was wild that I got as much sun as I got. I realized I didn’t get enough when I’m at home and I live at the beach!

Get outside, take your shirt off (if youre a woman, you can wear a swimsuit top) etc… Get the sun on your body, it’s good for you.
