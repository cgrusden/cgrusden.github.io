title: "when your business depends on you, you have a job"

“If youre business depends on you, you dont own a business - you have a job. And its the worst job in the world…” -Michael Gerber

So, everyday, when you tell yourself, or think to yourself, “I can’t let that person do that, I have to do it”… that is a to-do that you need to fix so someone else does it (most of it, taking and paying money are the only two things you should probably take care of but its a slippery slope because then more things start to become “oh that involves money I should do it”
