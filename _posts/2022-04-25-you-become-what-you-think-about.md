title: 'You become what you think about all day'
---

# What you tell yourself all day is what you become
I don’t know how to articulate this as well as others like Earl Nightingale, Dale Carnegie, or Jeffrey Gitomer (I’ll put the references to some of their books down below). They all tell you: you become what you think about all day long. 

If you say to yourself “I hope im not stressed”, or, “I feel stressed”,  guess what, you’ll be stressed. If you tell yourself “I’m not stressed, I feel great, everything is great”… and you repeat that shit all day long in your head for the 80,000 times we think about things during the day, you won’t be stressed. It’s literally that easy and that hard. 

Practicing what we preach is the second piece to this. If you’re gonna say this stuff, you better be doing it.
