title: "McDonalds breakfast sandwiches"
---

I'm a fan of the Egg McMuffin and the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese biscuit. They're delicious. The coffee isn't bad either. 

I learned something not too long ago about these from a friend that is older than I am. He said, next time you order a breakfast sandwich from McDonalds and it comes with an egg, make sure you ask them for a "real egg" on your sandwich. 
McDonalds uses real eggs, but what they do is use a pre cooked egg. When you ask for a "real egg", McDonalds will crack open a fresh egg and cook it and put it on your breakfast sandwich.
