# Removing yourself from Mint Magazine mailers
Call 904-281-8800 when you press 0 to talk to the customer service operator. You can request your address to be removed from their mailers. Apparently they are told to tell you that the contracts they write with their customers for advertising, that it may take up to 12 weeks to stop receiving the magazine at your address
