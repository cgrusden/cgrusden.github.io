You dont need to have some crazy level of discipline.  Just realize, things will go down and they’ll go down more than up, but when they go up they’ll go up really high. 

And over the long-term, when you look at 5 years out, you’re winning. No stress, no worry, whatever happens happens. What else will you do with the money? You’d invest it haha. Dumbass. Just focus on the day to day. Plan out your expenses, and see where you can make money. 

Doing long term options is better than short term.
