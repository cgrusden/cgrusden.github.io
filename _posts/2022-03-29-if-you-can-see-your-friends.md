title: 'If you can see your friends, see your friends'
---

Last week, while camping, I was around 45 minute drive from two friends of mine. I initially told myself, “They’re 45minutes away, I dont wanna drive 45minutes one way and then come back, thats 1.5 hours of travel to see my friends”.

I’m glad I said “Fuck it” and did it. Sure, they could have met me halfway, but it was during the workweek, and they had shit going on and I was camping. I made the effort. I’m glad I did. I’m always glad I do.

If you’re in a situation like this, just take the time and go see them if it’s within reason.
