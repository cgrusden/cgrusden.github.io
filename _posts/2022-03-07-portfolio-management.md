When you have assets, and their in the stock market, just let them ride. Don’t go full tilt and do dumb shit. You have money to use for this. Use it.  That’s what its there for, to generate income.  

Why not sell some puts that are way down the options chain? So you collect a little bit, and if the stock drops more, you have nothing to worry about. Its lower.
