title: 'Why-power instead of will-power'
---

I read the entire “The Compound Effect” book yesterday after my girlfriend had suggested I read it. It’s a really short book so I decided to just go for it and read the whole thing yesterday. 

Theres a lot of common sense stuff in it, again though, we all need daily reminders of the things we are on path to do or else we forget, everytime.

The biggest takeaway was: spend time thinking about your “why” for each aspect of your life and have laser-like focus on it. 

It's your “why” that gets you through the peaks and valleys of each day.
