title: 'Why-power instead of will-power'
---

I read the entire “The Compound Effect” book yesterday after my girlfriend had suggested I read it. It’s a really short book so I decided to just go for it and read the whole thing yesterday. 

Theres a lot of common sense stuff in it, again though, we all need daily reminders almost of things or else we forgot almost immediately.

The biggest takeaway was: spend time thinking about your “why” for each aspect of your life and get laser-like with it. 

Its your “why” that gets you through the peaks and valleys of each day.
