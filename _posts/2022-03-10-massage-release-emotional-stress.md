title: "Massage’s release emotional stress"
---

I did a quick google search and there are a lot of articles, some from therapists, that you may get emotional releases from massages that you get.

I get deep tissue massages because my muscles in my shoulder are locked up from an accident that happened a long time ago and I never did any massage therapy to release them.

When the massage therapist gets in there and hits a trigger point and other muscles start twitching, thats releasing a lot tension thats locked up.

Yesterday was big. There was a lot of twitching going on in my upper back after she jammed her fingers into my shoulder. I couldn’t sleep, it must have released a lot of stuff. Interesting though. The verdict is still out if this shit actually works like that, I’ll continue to do research and make my updates here.
