It's the day before New Years eve and i'm headed to "Disneyland for Horses" kinda place. The place is amazing. It's palacial. The entire grounds. The story that was told of how and why this place was built was good, but the real kicker was the ways this place makes money. The place has probably over 1,000 horse stalls, give or take a few. What do horses do? They shit. Guess what, their shit is worth something as manure to be used as fertilizer for the agriculture locals growing food. So people are paying to come to this horse disneyland. These same people pay to board their horses. They pay to have the manure removed. This guy turns around and sells the manure he's getting paid to remove. Genius.
