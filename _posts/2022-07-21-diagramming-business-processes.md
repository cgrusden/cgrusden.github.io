# Diagramming business processes

I’m a big fan of writing things out. It gets a bit verbose most of the time though. And it can be a lot to digest if you’re trying to build your business and improve it at the same time. Looking at pretty pictures quickly that show you what is going on is a little better than trying to read fifteen pages of process documents.

When working with a business consulting customer recently, he’s an engineer and engineers do really well by looking at diagrams and plans. After six months of consulting, I was taking a shower and realized I should bust out a few workflow diagrams to show what business processes we’ve worked on and the current one we’re working on.

After spending an hour thinking through the first process I was diagramming, I realized it took me longer than expected to diagram it because I had to think through the steps and question each step. Creating workflow diagrams I now see the value in them. It’s taken me twenty-years to see it, but I see it now. 

My belief on *when* to do diagrams is after you’ve started some basic processes. This way you can quickly make the diagrams and see how it’s all working currently from thirty thousand feet.
