Decided to not drink alcohol this entire weekend. It was easier to commit to that and just follow it. Not gonna lie, there was a moment where I almost told the waiter at the restaurant to bring a glass of champange that I could share with my girlfriend. We decided against that and just drank water the entire night and you know what, we had just a good of time. The next morning, most everyone was hungover that we were partying with. We were not. We were able to enjoy our morning, breakfast, and coffee without feeling bad. 

I'm over the alcohol.
