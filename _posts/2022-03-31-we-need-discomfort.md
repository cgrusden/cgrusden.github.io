title: 'We need discomfort'
---

/“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.” - Mark Twain/

The europeans get their “holiday” once a year. It’s an entire month they get off to go travel. Part of the reason this is helpful for them is that it helps them get out of their routine, have new sensory experiences, and to inject some uncomfortable into their lives. 

We need discomfort, we were built for it. If we don’t get out of bed when we don’t want to, if we take a cold shower when we could easily take a hot one, if we do these things regularly, its more helpful than perpetually having comfort.
