I got hot and heavy into shooting last year with my buddies. I didn’t really like guns before then. Maybe “indifferent” to them is a better way to put it.

Either way, I did what most people do I guess when they first get into shooting, I bought my first gun, then my second, third, fourth, and then a sold a few then bought a few that I really wanted. 

I’ve gone to the gun range quite a bit in the past year or so, and definitely put more than 3,000 rounds through my guns. 

I’m not bored with the gun range, I just want to learn more now. So I signed up for a CQB course.

CQB stands for close-quarters-battle. Basically clearing rooms with a handgun. 

If you have to get around your house because there’s an intruder or something, this would help you with angles to take and whatnot so you can see them but they can’t see you kinda thing.

Its 2-days, and 8 hours a day in Savannah, GA, Im stoked.
